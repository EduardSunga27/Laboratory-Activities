# Final Project: Comprehensive Student Portfolio (COSC 111)

### Overview: The Digital Archive

This capstone project serves as the culmination of the entire course. Rather than building a new circuit, the objective is to aggregate, organize, and present the complete body of work developed throughout the semester. It focuses on using professional Version Control tools to create a polished, accessible archive of your technical progress.

### What This Project Does

The system functions as a centralized library of your coding journey.

**The Compilation:** It consolidates every laboratory activity—from the basic blinking LED to the complex web-controlled IoT system—into a single, unified location.

**The Organization:** It ensures that every project is isolated and distinct. Instead of a messy pile of files, each activity is housed in its own dedicated folder to maintain clarity and structure.

**The Documentation:** It transforms raw code into understandable projects. Through the use of documentation files, the repository explains *what* each code block does, making it accessible to viewers who may not be familiar with the specific assignments.

### How It Works (The Instructions)

The project is built upon the structure of a GitHub Repository, requiring strict adherence to file management standards.

**Folder Hierarchy:** You must create a separate directory for each specific assignment (e.g., "Lab 1", "Midterm", "Final Exam"). This prevents asset conflicts and keeps the codebase clean.

**The "Read Me" (README.md):** For every folder, you are required to author a `README.md` file. This acts as the "manual" for that specific folder. It must describe the activity, explain the logic behind the code, and provide necessary context so a stranger could understand the project just by reading it.

**The Repository:** All of these folders and files are uploaded to a single GitHub repository, creating a shareable URL that serves as your digital portfolio.

### Key Concepts Applied

**Version Control (Git/GitHub):** Learning how to manage and publish software projects using industry-standard repository tools.

**Technical Documentation:** The skill of writing clear, descriptive summaries (using Markdown) to explain technical code to human readers.

**Project Management:** Organizing multiple distinct software modules into a cohesive, navigable structure.

**Professional Presentation:** Preparing a clean codebase that demonstrates technical competency to potential viewers or instructors.
